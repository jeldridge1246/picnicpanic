# picnicpanic
A short game I created in my final year of high school using Python 3 and the Pygame library.

It is simple game a little bit like "Snake." You control an ant running around a picnic blanket collecting food. Your goal is to get a high school. The ant becomes faster as it eats more food, making it harder to control. You also have to avoid red ants, poison, and running off the blanket.

All the game files are located in one directory. Running the game requires a Python 3 IDE with the Pygame library installed.
